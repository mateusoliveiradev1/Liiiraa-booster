# üöÄ Liiiraa Booster
[English](README.en.md) | [Portugu√™s](README.md)

This file contains the English instructions for setting up, building and testing the project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended).
2. Clone this repository and open the project folder.
3. Run `npm install` to download the dependencies.
4. For development run `npm run dev`, which uses **concurrently** and **cross-env** to launch `vite` and `electron .` with `NODE_ENV=development` and automatic reload.

## üì¶ Builds and Distribution

1. Generate optimized renderer files with `npm run build`.
2. Run `npm run dist` to create installers using **electron-builder**:
   - Windows: `.exe`
   - macOS: `.dmg`
   - Linux: `.AppImage`

## üß™ Tests

Before running the test suite you **must** install all dependencies:

1. Run `npm install` to download all project requirements. On CI environments prefer `npm ci` to ensure exact versions.
2. Then run `npm test` to start the test suite.

> **Important**: `npm test` will fail if the `node_modules/` directory does not exist.  
> Make sure to run `npm install` at least once before executing tests.

## üêç Python Requirements

To run the `metrics.py` script you need **Python 3** installed. Next, install the metrics dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `pynvml` package is optional and enables GPU metrics collection if an NVIDIA card is present.

These scripts are called by Electron through the `run-script` IPC channel.
Both `cpu-amd.ps1` and `cpu-intel.ps1` accept a `-Restore` flag to revert their registry and power plan tweaks.
